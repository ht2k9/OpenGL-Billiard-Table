# OpenGL Billiard Table

The game is developed in OpenGL, Visual Studio, using C.

To use it, you must have OpenGL glut libraries, it is well documented, easy to understand code.

Animation, physics, lightning and movements are all done with OpenGL.

*Note: 
The final version is lost, this code is little wet, has couple of TODOs and it slightly effects the collision.*
